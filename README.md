# Calculator
First long term programming project

Story time:
Towards the end of the summer going into freshman year, I emailed my programming teacher asking which languages we would be learning. When he told me that one was Java, I got started on learning myself. My first ever project was calc.java, a calculator which would take in two operands, and add, subtract, multiply, or divide them depending on if the input for "operator" was 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively.


e.g.


**Inputs:**

```
2
4
1
```

**Output:**

```
6
```

Next, I learned string methods, such as .equals() and made calc2.java. This was essentially calc.java but with words.

e.g.

**Inputs:**

```
2
4
addition
```

**Output:**

```
6
```

calc3.java was made around November of my freshman year (2015). I was very proud of calc3.java. It was a command line calculator which followed the rules of PEMDAS and gave an answer.

e.g.

**Input:**

```
4 * 2 / 6^2 - 6 * (2 - 1)
```

**Output:**

```
-5.77777777778
```

Then I learned about JFrame, and Calculator.java was made. This was calc3.java wrapped in a GUI with added features, such as an averaging calculator, variables that are definable by the user, etc. This is extremely stupid and its only purpose was me learning how to program.

To this day, if someone asks me for an example project, I tell them to make a calculator. I believe that it is an excellent project that can always be expanded to learn more. For example, calc.java used if statements and println. calc2.java used string methods and else ifs. calc3.java used methods, ArrayLists, comments, etc. Calculator.java used JFrame and other GUI classes, my own classes, an a few other topics.
